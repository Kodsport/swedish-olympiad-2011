\problemname{The Recipe}
You have decided to cook food.
To cook your dish you need $N$ ingredients.
For each ingredient you know the amount you have at home, the amount you need for the dish and the cost of the ingredient if you need to buy it.
That is, you are to buy the amount of each ingredient that you're currently missing.
Your task is to compute the total cost of cooking the dish.

\section*{Input}
The first line contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 5$), the number of ingredients.

The next $N$ lines describe an ingredient each $H, B, K$ ($0 \le H, B \le 1\,000$, $1 \le K \le 1\,000$) representing the amount that you have, the amount that is needed and how much the ingredient costs.

\section*{Output}
Output a single integer -- the total cost of the ingredients.

\section*{Scoring}
Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points.
To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group. Your final score will be the maximum score of a single submission.
